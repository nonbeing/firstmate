Mode: Codex daemon-backed normal supervision.

Run `bin/fm-codex-supervise-start.sh` in its own tracked terminal session.
It starts the existing singleton supervisor daemon in explicit `normal-codex` mode, which owns the watcher, re-arms it, and injects captain-relevant escalations only into a confirmed-idle Codex composer.
Do not run a foreground checkpoint while this daemon owns supervision.
The daemon preserves queued wakes, the watcher liveness beacon, and its existing busy/composer guards, so it never merges an escalation into typed input.
Do not use shell `&`, `nohup`, or a Codex background task to launch it.
Away mode remains the same daemon under `/afk`.
The `/afk` skill owns the durable `afk` <-> `normal-codex` ownership-transfer and return contract.

Validation on 2026-07-11 used Codex CLI 0.144.1 in a disposable tmux server with a scratch `FM_HOME` and no `state/.afk` flag.
The supervisor was started with `FM_HOME=<scratch> FM_SUPERVISOR_BACKEND=tmux FM_SUPERVISOR_TARGET=codex-normal:0 bin/fm-codex-supervise-start.sh`.
After `printf 'done: normal daemon wake smoke\n' > <scratch>/state/smoke.status`, the idle Codex primary received `Supervisor escalate (1 event(s)): smoke.status: done: normal daemon wake smoke (pre-read; re-arm not needed - watcher daemon-managed)` and replied `Acknowledged: normal daemon wake smoke completed; no re-arm needed.`
The daemon lock and watcher liveness beacon existed before that status write, and no primary input was sent after it.

The Herdr path was also validated on 2026-07-11 with Herdr 0.7.3 and Codex CLI 0.144.1 in the guarded lab session `fm-lab-codex-supervise-d4-9256-1249`.
A disposable Codex primary ran in pane `w1:p1` and the normal supervisor daemon ran in pane `w1:p2`; both inherited the same scratch `FM_HOME`.
The daemon target was `fm-lab-codex-supervise-d4-9256-1249:w1:p1`, with `FM_SUPERVISOR_BACKEND=herdr`.
After the primary was visibly idle, an external process wrote `done: real Herdr callback smoke` to `state/smoke.status`; no text, key, foreground checkpoint, or manual wake was sent to the Codex pane afterward.
Codex opened a new turn containing `Supervisor escalate (1 event(s)): smoke.status: done: real Herdr callback smoke (pre-read; re-arm not needed — watcher daemon-managed)`.
Daemon PID `42472` remained live, the watcher beacon advanced from epoch `1783789593` to `1783789628`, and the injected turn's session-start drain left `state/.wake-queue` at zero bytes, with no duplicate wake remaining.
The lab used one-second poll, signal-grace, batch, and housekeeping cadences to shorten the smoke; ownership, idle/composer guards, submit confirmation, queue drain, and watcher re-arm paths were unchanged.


The legacy checkpoint remains a bounded diagnostic and recovery tool only.
It drains an already-durable queue before taking a watcher lock.
Use `bin/fm-watch-checkpoint.sh --recover-missed-terminal` to force one heartbeat reconciliation for a terminal status missed in an earlier gap.
An ordinary checkpoint does not force that scan, so it cannot manufacture recovery wakes for terminal state already observed by the watcher.
It cannot provide continuous normal supervision because Codex does not reopen a fully ended session for a later filesystem write.
Do not run `bin/fm-watch-arm.sh` as Codex's normal supervision command.
The PreToolUse seatbelt in `.codex/hooks.json` denies a backgrounded, piped, or bundled watcher command.
